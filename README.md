# Insert Node in Binary Search Tree (BST)

C++ implementation of inserting a node into a Binary Search Tree (BST) with inorder traversal for verification.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to insert a value into a Binary Search Tree using C++.  
It includes a simple BST node structure, insertion logic, and traversal to verify correctness.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Recursion
- Tree traversal (Inorder)
- Struct usage in C++

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

The program includes:

- A **Node structure** representing BST nodes
- A **recursive function** to insert a node
- **Inorder traversal** to display sorted values

---

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

### Compile
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o bst

```

Run:
```
./bst
```

⏱ Complexity

Insertion in BST:

Average Time Complexity: O(log n)

Worst Case: O(n)

🛠 Language Used
C++

---

## Example Output

Before insertion:
20 30 40 50 60 70 80

After inserting 65:
20 30 40 50 60 65 70 80

---

## Problem explanation 
A Binary Search Tree maintains elements in sorted order.
Insertion places the new value in the correct position
based on BST properties.
